# AuthorTextRecognition
A simple Author Text Recognition program, using the naive Bayse algorithm.
This program is my project for AI course at Sofia university faculty of mathematics and informatics.
The algorithm works for any numbers of authors. You just have to download and modify my code a little.
I have wrote the program for only two authors. For every author you have to have
a file containing data (texts from the author) so the algorithm can "learn" from that data.
I have added the test files I have used and the data files I have used for each author.
